<h1>Analogy as the Hidden Engine of Euclidean Reasoning</h1>

<p>
Wittgenstein’s <em>duck-rabbit</em> figure is usually discussed in the context of 
perception and aspect-switching — as a way to show that interpretation is 
metaphor all the way down. The same drawing can be “a duck” or “a rabbit,” 
depending on the conceptual frame we activate. 
This reveals something deep: perception is not passive; it is analogical.
</p>

<p>
What has not been explored enough is how deeply this applies also to 
<em>geometric reasoning</em>.  
If the same drawing can be interpreted in multiple ways in ordinary perception, 
why couldn’t the same mechanism operate in mathematics?
</p>

<p>
Traditional logic treats analogies as informal and unreliable.  
But if we look at how the Greeks — especially Euclid and Plato — 
actually performed mathematics, 
we find not formal symbolic manipulation, but 
<em>chains of controlled aspect-switchings</em>.
The proof is not a derivation: it is a 
<em>guided traversal of interpretive frames</em>.

<h2>The Equilateral Triangle: A Cognitive Interpretation</h2>

<p>
Consider Euclid’s construction of an equilateral triangle on a given finite segment.
The diagram is always the same, yet during the proof we interpret its parts 
as belonging to different conceptual “worlds”:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the given segment as a <strong>distance constraint</strong>,</li>
  <li>the same segment as a <strong>radius</strong> of a circle,</li>
  <li>the two endpoints as <strong>centers of generative symmetry</strong>,</li>
  <li>the intersection point of the circles as a 
      <strong>double-aspect vertex</strong>: 
      at once “equidistant-from-A” and “equidistant-from-B”.</li>
</ul>

    Fig. 2 — The same diagram shifts conceptual identity multiple times during the proof.
  </div>
</div>

<h3>What the Proof Actually Does</h3>
<p>
The construction reveals the triangle’s property not by logical deduction alone, 
but by unifying the properties that emerge from the 
<em>different interpretations</em> of the same graph:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a <strong>circle construction</strong>: every point on the circumference is equidistant from its center.</li>
  <li>As a <strong>distance graph</strong>: AB is the shared unit that propagates to AC and BC.</li>
  <li>As a <strong>symmetry schema</strong>: the intersection is a fixed point of two equal radii.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By reconciling these distinct “readings,” the demonstration forces the 
equilateral triangle to appear as the inevitable synthesis of all interpretations.
</p>

<h2>Cognitive Insert: How Geometry Creates Concepts</h2>

<p>
Geometric diagrams show that the same visual structure can belong to multiple 
conceptual domains.  
The circle drawn in the construction is not a circle <em>as such</em>:  
it is the <strong>space of all possible manifestations</strong> 
of the point that maintains equal distance from the chosen center.  
A circle is therefore an <em>intersection</em> between the conceptual field of 
“points” and the conceptual field of “distance-constraints”.
</p>

<p>
Reconstructing the chain of analogies across Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> would reveal 
the implicit “grammar of concept creation” used by the Greeks.  
This same grammar is echoed in Aristotle’s <em>Analytica Posteriora</em>, 
where analogy and proportion — not set theory or predicate logic — 
structure scientific explanation.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, a Euclidean demonstration is not mere deduction:  
it is a controlled analogical ascent that stabilizes a concept 
by passing it through multiple interpretive worlds.
