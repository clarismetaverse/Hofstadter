<h1>Analogy as the Hidden Engine of Euclidean Reasoning</h1>

<p>
Wittgenstein’s <em>duck–rabbit</em> figure is usually discussed in the context of 
perception and aspect-switching: the same drawing can be seen <em>as</em> a duck or 
<em>as</em> a rabbit, depending on the conceptual frame we activate. 
This reveals something deep: perception is not passive; it is analogical.
</p>

<p>
What has not been explored enough is how deeply this applies also to 
<em>geometric reasoning</em>.  
If the same drawing can be interpreted in multiple ways in ordinary perception, 
why couldn’t the same mechanism operate in mathematics?
</p>

<p>
Traditional logic treats analogies as informal and unreliable.  
But if we look at how the Greeks — especially Euclid and Plato — 
actually performed mathematics, 
we find not formal symbolic manipulation, but 
<em>chains of controlled aspect-switchings</em>.
A proof is not just a derivation: it is a 
<em>guided traversal of interpretive frames</em>.
</p>

<h2>The Equilateral Triangle: A Gestalt of Multiple Identities</h2>

<p>
Consider Euclid’s construction of an equilateral triangle on a given finite segment.
The underlying <em>graph</em> of the figure is extremely simple — a segment, two circles, 
one intersection point — yet during the proof these same marks belong to 
different conceptual–perceptual planes.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <!-- QUI metti l’immagine gestaltica: base nera + cerchi/segmenti colorati -->
  <img src="equilateral-gestalt.png" alt="equilateral triangle gestalt construction">
  <div class="caption">
    Fig. 2 — A single black graph (segment AB, circles, point C) with two colored “readings”: 
    the red world of the circle centered at A, the blue world of the circle centered at B. 
    Euclid himself alternates between naming the segment as AB and BA depending on the center.
  </div>
</div>

<p>
In the “raw” drawing, the segment <span class="seg-base">AB</span> is just a line between two points.
But once we place a circle with center in A, 
<span class="seg-base">AB</span> becomes 
<span class="seg-A-red">“AB-as-radius-from-A”</span>.  
When we place a circle with center in B, the very same mark becomes 
<span class="seg-B-blue">“BA-as-radius-from-B”</span>.  
Historically, Euclid mirrors this by sometimes writing AB and sometimes BA,
quietly signalling the shift of center.
</p>

<p>
The intersection point C inherits this duality:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>in the red plane it is “a point on the circle of A” (hence AC = <span class="seg-A-red">AB</span>),</li>
  <li>in the blue plane it is “a point on the circle of B” (hence BC = <span class="seg-B-blue">BA</span>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cognitively, the proof proceeds by asking us to accept these colored identities 
as <em>simultaneously</em> true and then to fuse them.  
When we do so, the triangle acquires a new, composite identity:
<span class="seg-mixed">all three sides belong to both planes at once</span>.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <!-- opzionale: una seconda immagine con solo il triangolo e i lati sintetizzati -->
  <img src="equilateral-colored-triangle.png" alt="equilateral triangle with colored conceptual planes">
  <div class="caption">
    Fig. 3 — The same triangle: AC “in red”, BC “in blue”, and AB as the segment that 
    anchors both worlds. The equilateral property is the stabilized overlap of these readings.
  </div>
</div>

<h3>The Proof, Seen Through Its Colors</h3>

<p>
In symbolic textbooks, the argument is written in neutral form: 
“since C lies on the circle of center A with radius AB, AC = AB; 
since C lies on the circle of center B with radius BA, BC = BA; hence AB = AC = BC.”
</p>

<p>
Seen through the colored conceptual planes, the same steps become:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="seg-A-red">AB</span> is the chosen radius for the circle centered at A; 
    every point on that circle is at “red-distance AB” from A, 
    so AC inherits the red identity of <span class="seg-A-red">AB</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="seg-B-blue">BA</span> is the chosen radius for the circle centered at B; 
    every point on that circle is at “blue-distance BA” from B, 
    so BC inherits the blue identity of <span class="seg-B-blue">BA</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    But in the underlying black graph, 
    <span class="seg-base">AB</span> and <span class="seg-base">BA</span> are the same segment, 
    so the red and blue distances must collapse into a single invariant:
    <span class="seg-mixed">AB = AC = BC</span>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The demonstration unites all these interpretations and makes the property of the 
equilateral triangle appear not as a formal trick, but as the 
<b>inevitable synthesis of several coexisting conceptual worlds</b>.
</p>

<h2>Cognitive Insert: How Geometry Creates Concepts</h2>

<p>
Geometric diagrams show that the same visual structure can belong to multiple 
conceptual domains.  
The circle drawn in the construction is not a circle <em>as such</em>:  
it is the <strong>space of all possible manifestations</strong> 
of the point that maintains equal distance from the chosen center.  
A circle is therefore an <em>intersection</em> between the conceptual field of 
“points” and the conceptual field of “distance-constraints”.
</p>

<p>
Reconstructing the chain of analogies across Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> would reveal 
the implicit “grammar of concept creation” used by the Greeks.  
This same grammar is echoed in Aristotle’s <em>Analytica Posteriora</em>, 
where analogy and proportion — not set theory or predicate logic — 
structure scientific explanation.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, a Euclidean demonstration is not mere deduction:  
it is a controlled analogical ascent that stabilizes a concept 
by passing it through multiple interpretive worlds.
</p>

<p><strong>
In this sense, a geometric proof is nothing but a myth: 
a story we tell to reveal the good origin of an idea.
